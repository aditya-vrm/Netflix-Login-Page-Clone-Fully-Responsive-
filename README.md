A high-fidelity, fully responsive clone of the Netflix landing page built with semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3. This project focuses on recreating complex UI elements like the curved section separators, "Trending Now" horizontal scrollable poster lists with overlaid rank numbering, and a mobile-first design approach.

Key Technical Highlights:

Responsive Architecture: Leverages CSS Media Queries to ensure a seamless experience from 320px mobile screens to large desktops.

Modern CSS Layouts: Extensively uses Flexbox for navigation, grid systems for footer links, and precise positioning for the "Top 10" numbering system.

Advanced Styling: Implementation of custom SVG icons, radial/linear gradients for depth, and hover transitions for an interactive user experience.

Pixel Perfect: Meticulous attention to typography, spacing, and the iconic Netflix color palette.
